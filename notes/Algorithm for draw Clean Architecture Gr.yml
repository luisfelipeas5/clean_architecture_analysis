Algorithm for draw Clean Architecture Graph

1. List components
2. List dependencies for each component
3. Order components by smallest component.order first to the biggest
4. Creates circurference axis for each order:
  - Calculate the size of the circurference of each order
    - ratio = (number of components) x order * constant
  - Save the calculation
5. For each component:
  - Get order axis circurference calculation
  - Calculate the component place on order circurference axis based on dependencies with smaller order on insider circuference
  - If coordinate is already taken, take the next coordinates
